Ca = center of interval a, and Ta = tolerance of a
then
a = [Ca*(1 - Ta), Ca*(1 + Ta)]
and
b = [Cb*(1 - Tb), Cb*(1 + Tb)]
so, assuming positive a and b
a*b = [Ca*Cb*(1 - 2*(Ta + Tb) + Ta*Tb), Ca*Cb*(1 + 2*(Ta + Tb) + Ta*Tb)]
if Ta and Tb are small, then Ta*Tb will be very small
so the tolerance of the product will be approximately
the 2 times the sum of the tolerances of the factors.
