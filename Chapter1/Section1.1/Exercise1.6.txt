The procedure would perform exactly the same, in a normal
order environment. However, in an applicative order environment
sqrt-iter would be called recursively to infinity because
the new-if evaluates it's operands fully, before being called.
The original, special form of if explicitly uses normal
order operation, thereby avoiding such problems.
